/*Polynomial regression

Sometimes, the trend of data is not really linear, and looks curvy. In this case we can use Polynomial regression methods. In fact, many different regressions exist that can be used to fit whatever the dataset looks like, such as quadratic, cubic, and so on, and it can go on and on to infinite degrees.

In essence, we can call all of these, polynomial regression, where the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent 
variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Lets say you want to have a polynomial regression (let's make 2 degree polynomial):
𝑦
Now, the question is: how we can fit our data on this equation while we have only x values, such as Engine Size? Well, we can create a few additional features: 1,  𝑥 , and  𝑥2 .

PolynomialFeatures() function in Scikit-learn library, drives a new feature sets from the original feature set. That is, a matrix will be generated consisting of all polynomial combinations of the features with degree less than or equal to the specified degree. For example, lets say the original feature set has only one feature, ENGINESIZE. 
Now, if we select the degree of the polynomial to be 2, then it generates 3 features, degree=0, degree=1 and degree=2: */
